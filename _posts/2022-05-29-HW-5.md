title: "A Simple Message Bank"
---

*In this blog post, I will create a simple webapp using Flask, a python web framework.*

This app we are going to build is a simple message bank. It will do two things:

1. Allow the user to submit messages to the bank.
2. Allow the user to view a sample of the messages currently stored in the bank.

**This code for our app must be hosted in a GitHub repository.** Let's begin by creating such a repository. Commit and push each time we successfully add a new piece of functionality or resolve a bug.

Here's a link to my projects repository:
