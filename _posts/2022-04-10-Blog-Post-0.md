## Homework 0

*Here I will write a tutorial explaining how to construct an interesting data visualization of the Palmer Penguins data set.*

## Import the Necessary Packages

First you need to import the following package by running the following code:

``` python
import pandas as pd
```
Pandas allows you to store the data in a dataframe. 

## Reading the Data into Python

Then you need to read the data by running the following code:

``` python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

## Clean the Data Set

Next, let's make the data set easier to read by running the following code:

``` python
penguins = penguins.dropna(subset = ["Body Mass (g)", "Sex"])
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)
penguins = penguins[penguins["Sex"] != "."]

cols = ["Species", "Island", "Sex", "Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)", "Flipper Length (mm)", "Body Mass (g)"]
penguins = penguins[cols]
```

1. In the first line, we drop any nans (null data) that is in the columns "Body Mass (g)", "Sex". 
2. In the second line, we shorten the penguins scientific name to either "Adelie", "Chinstrap", and "Gentoo". 
3. In the third line, we take out the "." that was mistakenly int he data under the column "Sex". 
4. In the fourth line, we only use the columns that are necessary to our needs. So we use a list named "cols" to store the column names.
5. In the fifth line, we changed the data set to only store the data from the columns listed in the "cols" list from line four. 

## View our Pandas Data Set

Let's make sure that the data looks properly cleaned by running the following code:

``` python
penguins.head()
```
Once the data set looks organized and cleaned, we can move on to constructing a data visualization.

## Constructing a Data Visualization

Here we will be constructing a scatter plot by running the following code:

``` python
fig = px.scatter(data_frame = penguins, # data that needs to be plotted
                 x = "Culmen Length (mm)", # column name for x-axis
                 y = "Culmen Depth (mm)", # column name for y-axis
                 color = "Species", # column name for color coding
                 width = 500,
                 height = 300)

# reduce whitespace
fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0})
# show the plot
fig.show()
```
