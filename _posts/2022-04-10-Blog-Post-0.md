## Homework 0

*Here I will write a tutorial explaining how to construct an interesting data visualization of the Palmer Penguins data set.*

## Import the necessary packages

First you need to import the following package by running the following code:

``` Python
import pandas as pd
```
Pandas allows you to store the data in a dataframe. 

## Reading the data into Python

Then you need to read the data by running the following code:

``` Python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

## Clean the data set

Next, let's make the data set easier to read by running the following code:

``` Python
penguins = penguins.dropna(subset = ["Body Mass (g)", "Sex"])
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)
penguins = penguins[penguins["Sex"] != "."]

cols = ["Species", "Island", "Sex", "Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)", "Flipper Length (mm)", "Body Mass (g)"]
penguins = penguins[cols]
```
