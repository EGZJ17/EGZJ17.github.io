title: "Movie and Tv Show Recomendations if you love Friends"
---

*In this blog post, I will be using the Scrapy Python package to extract data from the IMDB website. I will build a simple recommendation system that will recommend movies or TV shows based on the number of actors a title shares with my favorite TV show, Friends.*

# ยง1. Setup
## ยง1.1 Locate the Starting IMDB Page

Pick your favorite movie or TV show, and locate its IMDB page. For example, my favorite TV show is Friends. Its IMDB page is at:
```
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/
```
Save this URL for a moment.

## ยง1.2 Initialize your scrapy project
1. Create a new GitHub repository, and sync it with GitHub Desktop. This repository will house your scraper. **You should commit and push each time you make significant changes to your code.**
2. Open a terminal in the location of your repository on your laptop, and type: 
```
conda activate PIC16B
scrapy startproject IMDB_scraper
cd IMDB_scraper
```
This will create quite a lot of files, but you don't really need to touch most of them.

# ยง2. Write Your Scraper

Create a file inside the `spiders` directory called `imdb_spider.py`. Add the following lines to the file: 

```python
# to run 
# scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o movies.csv

import scrapy

class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'imdb_spider'
    
    start_urls = ['hhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/']
```
Replace the entry of `start_urls` with the URL corresponding to your favorite movie or TV show.
